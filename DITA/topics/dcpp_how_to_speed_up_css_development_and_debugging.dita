    <title>How to Speed up CSS Development and Debugging</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context id="context_vtz_2kn_cfb">
      <p>You can considerably speed up your CSS development by avoiding invoking the entire pipeline
        of transforming your DITA maps to PDF. Instead, you can use the merged map and transform it
        directly to PDF.</p>
    </context>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>Transform your DITA Map to PDF using the transformation scenario you are using:
            <uicontrol>DITA Map PDF - based on HTML5 &amp; CSS</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>DITA Map
            PDF - based on DITA &amp; CSS</uicontrol></cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Open in the editor the <xref
            href="dcpp_debugging_the_css.dita#dcpp_debugging_the_css/merged_map_file">merged
            file</xref> (*.merged.html or *.merged.xml) that is located in the output
          directory.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Configure a <uicontrol>XML to PDF transformation with CSS</uicontrol> scenario. Do not
          add set here CSS files since the merged file already contains pointers to the stylesheets.
          This scenario uses the Chemistry CSS processor.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Optionally, Enable the output of the CSS processor using the editor preferences: <menucascade>
            <uicontrol>Options</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>XML</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>PDF Processors</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>CSS Processor</uicontrol>
          </menucascade></cmd>
      </step>
    </steps>
    <result id="result_nrt_1mn_cfb">
      <p>Now you can make incremental changes to the CSS stylesheet and quickly see the results by
        transforming directly the merged file.<note type="fastpath">If your changes involve only
          element styling, with no specific paged media CSS rules and properties, you can simply
          open the merged file in a browser (like Chrome or Firefox) and refresh at each CSS change,
          as shown in: <xref href="dcpp_debugging_the_css.dita"/></note></p>
