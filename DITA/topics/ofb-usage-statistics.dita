    <p id="p_odx_dgk_54b">The top half of the page displays statistics for page views and/or comments in a graph form
      according to the selected filtering options. The bottom half of the page displays the
      statistics for each selected site configuration in a table with numeric values. You can click
      the up or down arrow to the right of the title for each column header to sort that particular
      column. If you click the name of the site configuration, you will be directed to that
      particular site configuration. By default, the table is sorted in the descending order of the
      number of page views from the last column of the table (last month or last day of the selected
      period). You can click the arrow to the left of the site configuration name in the first
      column to expand the particular site configuration to show its configured versions. By
      default, the versions are sorted chronologically in this table.</p>
