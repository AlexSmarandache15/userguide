  <title>Chapter Scope Numbering</title>
  <body>
    <p>If you want to make each chapter independent (so it can be read separately, as a separate
      part of your publication), you need the make the page counter, figure, and table counters
      restart at each chapter. </p>
    <p>The links between elements in different chapters also need to be changed. They have to
      display the chapter number before the page number to clearly specify the target.</p>
