	<title>Deep Chapter Scope Numbering Details</title>
	<body>
		<p>This is a way to make each chapter independent (so it can be read separately, as a separate
			part of your publication). The page counter, figure, and table counters restart at each
			chapter start - like in the following example: </p>
		<codeblock outputclass="language-ini">1. First Chapter
	Table 1.1 Installation
	Table 1.2 Prerequisites
2. Second Chapter
	Table 2.1 Tools
	Table 2.2 Accessories
3. Third Chapter
	Table 3.1 Cleanup</codeblock>
		<p>The links are also changed. They display the chapter number before the page number to clearly
			specify the target.</p>
