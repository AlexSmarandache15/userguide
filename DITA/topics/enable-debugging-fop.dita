  <title>How to Enable Debugging for FO Processor Transformations</title>
  <body>
    <p>If you encounter errors when running PDF transformations that use an FO processor, it is
      possible to enable debugging/logging to help you identify the problem. To enable
      debugging/logging for FO processing, follow this procedure:<ol>
        <li>Locate and edit the following configuration file: <filepath><term
              conkeyref="reusables-user-guide/oxy-install-dir"
            ></term>/tools/config/log4j.xml</filepath>.<note>You need write access to this folder,
            so if you do not have administrator permissions, you may first need to copy the file to
            another location where you have write access.</note></li>
        <li>Edit the <codeph>priority</codeph> element (inside the <codeph>root</codeph> element)
          and change its value to <b>debug</b>.</li>
        <li>Save the file in the original location.</li>
        <li>Restart <ph keyref="product"></ph> and re-run the transformation.<note type="tip">It is
            recommended that you use a small input file when trying to reproduce the problem, to
            make it easier to analyze the data in the log.</note></li>
        <li>Once you are finished with the debugging session, remember to edit the
            <filepath>log4j.xml</filepath> file and change the <codeph>priority</codeph> element
          back to its original value. Otherwise, performance could be affected.</li>
      </ol></p>
