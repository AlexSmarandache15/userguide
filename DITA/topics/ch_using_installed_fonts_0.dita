  <body>
    <p>Let say you want to style some elements using a font that is available on your system. On
      Windows, it means it was installed in the Windows/Fonts directory. In such a case you can
      refer it
      directly:<codeblock outputclass="language-css">section h2 {
    font-family: Calibri;
}</codeblock></p>
