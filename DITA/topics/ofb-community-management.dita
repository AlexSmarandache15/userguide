    <p>The <uicontrol>Community</uicontrol> page is where users with a role of <i>Owner</i>,
        <i>Admin</i>, or <i>Moderator</i> can see all the users for the site configuration. It
      displays members of the site management team (<i>Owner</i>, <i>Admin</i>, or <i>Moderator</i>)
      and any other user who has posted a comment on the website where the Feedback system is
      installed for the particular site configuration. To reach this page, click the
          <uicontrol><image href="../img/ofb-Community16.png" id="image_txz_51g_gjb"
        />Community</uicontrol> link in the left menu bar in the interface for the site
      configuration.</p>
