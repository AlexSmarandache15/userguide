    <p id="p_ub3_dgk_54b">A file conflict occurs when two or more developers have changed the same few lines of a file
      or the properties of the same file. As Subversion knows nothing of your project, it leaves
      resolving the conflicts to the developers. Whenever a conflict is reported, you should open
      the file in question, and try to analyze and resolve the conflicting situation.</p>
