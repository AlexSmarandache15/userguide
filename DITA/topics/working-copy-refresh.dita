  <title>Refresh a Working Copy</title>
  <body>
    <p id="p_ajj_dgk_54b">A refresh is a frequent operation triggered automatically when you switch between two working
      copies using the toolbar selector of the <uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view and when you
      switch between <ph keyref="product"/> and other applications. </p>
    <p id="p_bjj_dgk_54b">The <uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view features a fast refresh mechanism: the content
      is cached locally when loading the working copy for the first time. Later on, when the same
      working copy is displayed again, the application uses this cache to detect the changes between
      the cached content and the current content found on disk. The refresh operation is run on
      these changes only, thus improving the response time. improvement is noticeable especially
      when working with large working copies.</p>
