    <p><ph keyref="product"/> features a user-friendly administration interface where you can
      moderate comments, manage users, and configure various settings, notifications, and other
      components of the comment system. This administration interface is reached by logging in to
      your Feedback account in the <xref href="ofb-installing-feeback.dita"><i>administration login
          page</i></xref>.</p>

      <title>What is a Site?</title>
      <p>In <ph keyref="product"/>, a <term>site</term> is a shorter name for a <term>site
          configuration</term>. A site configuration provides the means to moderate comments, manage
        users, configure the comment system, and install it in your website or WebHelp
        documentation.</p>

      <title>Sites Page </title>
      <p>When you log in to the administration interface, you start with the
          <uicontrol>Sites</uicontrol> page. This is where you can add site configurations and
        manage existing ones. Each site configuration is displayed as a tile. Each tile displays the
        avatar, name, and description for the particular site configuration. Also, if the site
        configuration has the <xref href="ofb-editing-site.dita#ofb-editing-site/comment-moderation"
            ><uicontrol>Comment Moderation</uicontrol> option enabled</xref>, the number of pending
        comments are displayed if users have posted comments that have not yet been moderated. You
        can click anywhere in the center box of a tile to open the <xref
          href="ofb-moderating-comments.dita"><uicontrol>Comments</uicontrol> page</xref> for that
        particular configuration. This page is used to moderate and manage comments. You can click
        the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ofb-Settings17.png" id="image_gmj_s5y_fjb"
          />Settings</uicontrol> button at the bottom-right corner of a tile to open the
          <uicontrol>General Settings</uicontrol> page for that particular configuration. This page
        is where you can edit the avatar, name, or description of a site configuration and it
        includes some other options that can be set according to your needs.</p>
      <p>When you <xref href="ofb-creating-site.dita">create a site configuration</xref>, you are
        assigned a user role of <i>Owner</i> for that site and the tiles for that site will be
        displayed in the <uicontrol>Sites</uicontrol> page whenever you log in. If another person
        creates a site and gives you a user role of <i>Admin</i> or <i>Moderator</i>, the tiles for
        those sites will also be displayed for your account. The avatar for the site <i>Owner</i> is
        displayed at the top-right corner of each tile (you can hover over the avatar to see their
        name).</p>
      <p>If you have a lot of site configurations, you can use the <uicontrol>Search</uicontrol> bar
        to filter the tiles. The filter component looks for the entered search terms in the name and
        description of the site configurations.</p>
