            <title>Condition</title>
            <p>When your custom styles are not applied and in the transformation output (in the
        results console view) you get errors containing one of: <codeph>I/O exception</codeph>,
          <codeph>Unknown host</codeph>, <codeph>Error parsing</codeph>.</p>
        </condition>
        <troubleSolution>
            <cause>
                <title>Cause</title>
                <p>One of the CSS files contains references to resources from other website that is
          currently inaccessible. These resources may include: <ul id="ul_bbj_4fs_g2b">
            <li>fonts</li>
            <li>images</li>
            <li>other CSSs</li>
          </ul>Please note that if you exported one of the built-in publishing templates from the
          transformation scenario dialog, there might be chances the associated CSSs use Google
          Fonts. </p>

                <steps>
                    <step>
            <cmd>Double check your proxy settings, ask the system administrator for help.</cmd>
          </step>
          <step>
            <cmd>If the server is still inaccessible from the transformation process, download the
              remote resources using a web browser, save them in the customization CSS file folder,
              and refer them directly from your CSS. In case the problem is caused by a remote font,
              please see <xref
