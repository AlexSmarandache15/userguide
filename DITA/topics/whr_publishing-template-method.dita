        <p>Using a WebHelp Publishing Template to customize your output is the recommended
      customization method. </p>
    <p>We recommend this method because a publishing template package is self-contained. The
      customization is packed in a ZIP archive that can be shared with your team. Also, using this
      customization method allows you easily update to a new version of <ph keyref="product"/>.</p>
