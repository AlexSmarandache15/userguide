      <p id="p_srm_dgk_54b"><ph keyref="product"/> makes it easy to create a reusable component from
        existing topic content.<note id="note_trm_dgk_54b">To ensure that the topic file that
          contains the reusable component is a valid container for the reusable content component,
            <ph keyref="product"/> attempts to use the same schema information in the current topic
          for the file that contains the reused component. If it cannot create a valid instance of
          the reused content file with this approach, the application creates a specialized topic
          type automatically. This specialization is designed to make sure that the content is
          compatible with the topic type that it is created from. You can make changes to the
          configuration file (<filepath id="filepath_lkz_fnc_j4b"
            >OXYGEN_INSTALL_DIR\frameworks\dita\reuse\reuse_configuration.properties</filepath>) or
          override it from a framework extension to control if the created reusable component file
          should be based on the currently edited topic or it should be an automatically created
          DITA specialization topic.</note></p>
      <p id="p_urm_dgk_54b">Follow these steps to create a reusable component:</p>
    </context>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>In <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode, select the content you want to make into a
          reusable component (or place the cursor inside an element you want to reuse).</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Select the <uicontrol>Create Reusable Component</uicontrol> action that is available in
          the <uicontrol>DITA</uicontrol> menu or the <uicontrol>Reuse</uicontrol> submenu of the
          contextual menu.</cmd>
        <stepresult>The <uicontrol>Create Reusable Component</uicontrol> dialog box is
          displayed.</stepresult>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Use the <uicontrol>Reuse Content</uicontrol> drop-down list to select the scope of the
          content to be made reusable. It allows you to select how much of the current content you
          want to make reusable. The choices presented include the element at the current cursor
          position and its ancestor elements.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Add a description. This is used as a description for the reusable component, but is not
          part of the reused content. It is just to help you identify the reusable content and will
          not become part of your output.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>If the <uicontrol>Replace selection with content reference</uicontrol> option is
          selected, the selection in the current topic will be replaced with a content reference
            (<xmlatt>conref</xmlatt>) that points to the new reusable component. If multiple
          elements are selected (for example, multiple steps or list items), the selection is
          replaced with a content reference range (<xmlatt>conref</xmlatt> and
            <xmlatt>conrefend</xmlatt>).</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Select a file name and location to save the topic containing the reusable component and
          click <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol>. It is considered best practice to save or store
          reusable components in an area set aside for that purpose.</cmd>
      </step>
    </steps>
    <result>
      <p id="p_vrm_dgk_54b">A file is created that contains <b>one</b> reusable component. You can
        reference the reused content in other topics by using a <xref
          href="eppo-create-conref.dita#eppo-create-conref">content reference</xref> or <xref
          href="eppo-create-conkeyref.dita#eppo-create-conkeyref">content key reference</xref>.
        Also, if the <uicontrol>Replace selection with content reference</uicontrol> option was
        selected, <ph keyref="product"/> replaces the selected content with a content reference that
        will be displayed in your current topic with a gray background and it can only be edited in
        the source file (the new reusable component). To edit the source file, click the
            <uicontrol><image href="../img/editContent.png" id="image_p2t_wwm_wr"/>Edit
          Content</uicontrol> icon at the beginning of the content reference.</p>
