  <title>Breaks between lines: Widows and Orphans</title>
  <body>
    <p>There are cases in which the page break is placed between paragraph lines. For aesthetic
      purposes it is required that at least several lines remain in the first, i.e. the paragraph is
      not left with just a single line. Another constraint might be the number of lines that are
      moved to the next page. Again, it should be avoided to move just a single line. CSS <xref
        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-break-20120823/#best-breaks" scope="external"
        format="html">defines</xref> two properties for this type of control:</p>
    <p><ol id="ol_ag5_hzm_vz">
        <li>The <codeph>orphans</codeph> property specifies the minimum number of line boxes that
          should be left in a paragraph before the page break occurs. </li>
        <li>The <codeph>widows</codeph> property specifies the minimum number of line boxes of a
          block container that must be left in a paragraph created on the next page after a
          break.</li>
      </ol> This is an example, showing how to keep the paragraphs at least four lines on the page
      before the break, and two lines on the page following the break:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-css">p {
  orphans: 4;
  widows: 2;
}</codeblock>
