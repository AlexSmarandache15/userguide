    <title>How to control the image size in complex static content</title>
    <body>
        <p>It is common to have text and images mixed together in a :before or :after pseudo
            element. For example, for the notes you may have both artwork and text:</p>
        <codeblock>*[class ~= "topic/note"]::before {
    content: url('note.png') "Some text";
}</codeblock>
        <p/>
        <p>If you want to change the size of the image you have two options:</p>
        <ol id="ol_j4g_tfj_fhb">
            <li>Use the <codeph>image-resolution</codeph> CSS property:
                <codeblock>*[class ~= "topic/note"] {
    image-resolution:300dpi;
}</codeblock></li>
            <li> Separate the image from the text and apply the width and height CSS properties only
                on the image, using the width and height properties. You could use multiple
                ":before" pseudo-elements for that, considering that the farthest content presented
                before the actual content of an element is the one matched by the :before with the
                highest number in the brackets:</li>
        </ol>
        <codeblock>*[class ~= "topic/note"]:before(2) {
    content: url('note.png') ;
    width:0.5in;
}

*[class ~= "topic/note"]:before(1) {
    content: "Some text";
}</codeblock>
    </body>
</topic>
