      specific needs. The WebHelp system includes several output variants that can be customized in
      numerous ways:<ul>

          layout and is designed to adapt to any device and screen size to provide an optimal
          viewing and interaction experience. It is based upon the <i>Bootstrap</i> responsive
          front-end framework and is available for DITA document types. The <b>WebHelp Responsive
            with Feedback</b> variant allows your users to add comments to your output. You also
          have customization options, including ways to create and customize the templates used to
          create this type of output.</li>
        <li><b>WebHelp Classic (with or without feedback enabled)</b> - Designed for desktop systems
          and features a familiar <i>tri-pane</i> layout. You can use this system to publish DITA
          and DocBook document types. The <b>WebHelp Classic with Feedback</b> variant allows your
