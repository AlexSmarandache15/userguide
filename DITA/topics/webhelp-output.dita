    <p>The <ph keyref="product"></ph> provides support for customizing the output to suit your
      specific needs.  The WebHelp system includes several output variants that can be customized in
      numerous ways:<ul>
        <li><b>WebHelp Responsive (with or without feedback enabled)</b> - Features a very flexible
          layout and is designed to adapt to any device and screen size to provide an optimal
          viewing and interaction experience. It is based upon the <i>Bootstrap</i> responsive
          front-end framework and is available for DITA document types. The <b>WebHelp Responsive
            with Feedback</b> variant allows your users to add comments to your output.</li>
        <li><b>WebHelp Classic (with or without feedback enabled)</b> - Designed for desktop systems
          and features a familiar <i>tri-pane</i> layout. You can use this system to publish DITA
          and DocBook document types. The <b>WebHelp Classic with Feedback</b> variant allows your
          users to add comments to your output.</li>
      </ul>
