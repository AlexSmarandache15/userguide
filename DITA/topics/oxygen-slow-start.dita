    <p><?oxy_comment_start author="Steven" timestamp="20161026T153539+0300" comment="different structure than the rest"?><b>Problem:</b>
      Some anti-virus software can cause Java applications, such as <ph keyref="product"/>, to start
      very slowly due to scanning of compressed archives (such as the JAR libraries that all Java
      applications use).</p>
    <p><b>Solution:</b> The <?oxy_comment_end?>solution is to add the <ph keyref="product"/> folder
      to the list of exceptions in the anti-virus software settings.</p>
