        <p><ph keyref="product"/> is a flexible, intuitive collaboration platform designed to adapt
      to virtually any type of workflow that a collaborative team may use for their documentation
      life cycle. It allows a <b>Content Author</b> to upload documents that need to be reviewed by
      subject matter experts or other team members. The <b>Reviewers</b> simply follow a link and
      login to <ph keyref="product"/> where they can access the uploaded documents to review, add
      comments, or contribute changes. They can share the files with other <b>Reviewers</b> and all
      of them can communicate with each other and the <b>Content Author</b> directly from the <ph
        keyref="product"/> interface. Ultimately, the <b>Content Author</b> has access to a
        <i>Merge</i> tool that allows them to automatically merge all of the changes back into
      Oxygen XML Editor or Oxygen XML Author.</p>
