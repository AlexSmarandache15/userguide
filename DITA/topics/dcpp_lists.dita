    <p>You can style the list item markers, or other properties.</p>
		<p>
			<note>The lists are treated differently from ordinary block elements, in the sense their
				margins are not collapsing with the ones of the neighbouring blocks or lists. This is also
				visible for the nested lists.</note>
