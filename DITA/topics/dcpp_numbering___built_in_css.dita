  <title>Numbering - Built-in CSS</title>
  <body>
    <p>The built-in CSS rules are in: </p>
		<ul id="ul_dfl_qj3_rhb">
			<li><filepath>[PLUGIN_DIR]/css/print/p-numbering-shallow.css</filepath></li>
			<li><filepath>[PLUGIN_DIR]/css/print/p-numbering-deep.css</filepath></li>
			<li><filepath>[PLUGIN_DIR]/css/print/p-numbering-deep-chapter-scope.css</filepath></li>
		</ul>
		<p>The first CSS contains the rules that add a "Chapter NN" before the first-level topics from
			the publication, the later contains rules that add a deep structure of counters on all topics
			referred from the map, at any level, and the last one creates a chapter scope oriented
			numbering,</p>
