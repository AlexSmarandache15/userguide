      <title>Browser Runs Out of Memory When Trying to Edit Large Files</title>
      <p>When <ph keyref="webappProduct"/> renders documents, it causes the browser to consume more
        memory than the original document size. To work with large documents, you can configure <ph
          keyref="webappProduct"/> to fold some of the elements by default. To do this, you need to
        create a custom CSS file that specifies the folding (for example, specifying that all the
        sections are folded by
        default):<codeblock outputclass="language-css">section{
    -oxy-foldable:true;
    -oxy-folded: true;
    -oxy-not-foldable-child: title;
}</codeblock></p>
      <p>To test it, you can reference the CSS file in a processing instruction at the top of the
        document:<codeblock outputclass="language-xml">&lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="MyCustom.css"?></codeblock></p>
      <p>For production purposes, you may want to <xref
          href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-waCustom/topics/customizing_frameworks.html"
          format="html" scope="external">configure a custom framework</xref> that associates the CSS
        file to large XML documents.</p>
