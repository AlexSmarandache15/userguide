    <title>Implicit Page Breaks</title>
    <body>
        <p>A page break will be created each time there is a change in the <codeph>page</codeph> property associated to the elements in a sequence. Consider you have a sequence of div elements, one of them associated with a "cover" page, others with a "content" page:</p>
        <codeblock outputclass="language-css">div.cover {
    page: cover;
}

div.content {
    page: content;
}</codeblock>
        <p>The XML document:</p>
        <codeblock outputclass="language-xml">...
&lt;div class="cover"> Welcome to the User Guide... &lt;/div>
&lt;div class="content"> Here are the details... &lt;/div>
&lt;div class="content"> Here are some more details... &lt;/div></codeblock>
        <p>There will be a forced page break between the first <codeph>div</codeph> and the second, because of the <codeph>page</codeph> change.<note><ph keyref="product"/> breaks also the page between the two <codeph>div</codeph> elements with class "content". Although not respecting the CSS specification, it makes easier to implement page breaks for a technical book. You could have a "chapter" page associate to a sequence of elements. There will be no need for additional <codeph>page-break-before</codeph> properties.</note></p>
