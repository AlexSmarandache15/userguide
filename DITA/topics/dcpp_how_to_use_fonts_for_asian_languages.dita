    <title>How to Use Fonts for Asian Languages</title>
    <body>
    <p>For Asian languages you must use a font or a sequence of fonts that cover the needed
      character ranges. If the characters are not found, the # symbol is used.</p>
    <p>When you specify a sequence of fonts, if the glyphs are not found in the first font the next
      font is selected until one covering all the glyphs is found. A common font sequence for Asian
      languages is used in the next example.</p>
    <p>In your <xref href="dcpp_the_customization_css.dita">customization css</xref> add:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-css">:root {
  font-family: Calibri, SimSun, "Malgun Gothic";
}</codeblock>
