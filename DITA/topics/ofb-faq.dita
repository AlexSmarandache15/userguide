          <dt><b>Question:</b> Why do I need Oxygen Feedback?</dt>
          <dd><b>Answer:</b> It gives your customers a voice as well as an affective way for you to
            interact with them. It provides your customers with a fast and simple way to offer
            feedback or ask questions and it provides you with a very efficient system for
            responding, moderating comments, and managing the comment system.</dd>

          <dt><b>Question:</b> Is Oxygen XML Editor/Author required to use Oxygen Feedback?</dt>
          <dd><b>Answer:</b> No. Although, <b>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</b> is required to integrate
              <ph keyref="product"/> into WebHelp documentation, it can be embedded on any
            HTML-based webpage.</dd>

          <dt><b>Question:</b> Do I need my own server to manage and integrate Oxygen Feedback?</dt>
          <dd><?oxy_comment_start author="steven_higgs" timestamp="20191007T113500+0300" comment="Is this accurate? I made an assumption."?><b>Answer:</b>
            No. While this might be a beneficial feature in upcoming releases, there will always be
            cloud-based options for administering <ph keyref="product"/> without the need for your
            own server.<?oxy_comment_end?></dd>

          <dt><b>Question:</b> Is there a demo or trial version for an administrator so that I can
            add Oxygen Feedback to my website and see it in action?</dt>
          <dd><?oxy_comment_start author="steven_higgs" timestamp="20191007T113747+0300" comment="This is also an assumption. Let me know if this answer is accurate."?><b>Answer:</b>
            Yes. If you already own a license for <b>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</b>, you can use <ph
              keyref="product"/> for free on one domain. If you do not have a license for <b>Oxygen
              XML Editor/Author</b>, you can request a 30-day trial at: <xref
              href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/register.html?p=editor" format="html"
              scope="external"/>.<?oxy_comment_end?></dd>

          <dt><b>Question:</b> Can I decide which comments posted by my customers are
            displayed?</dt>
          <dd><b>Answer:</b> Yes. There is an option that specifies whether or not comments are
            moderated and if that option is enabled, all new or edited comments require approval
            from an Administrator or Moderator.</dd>
