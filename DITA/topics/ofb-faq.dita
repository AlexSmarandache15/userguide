          <dt><b>Question:</b> Why do I need Oxygen Feedback?</dt>
          <dd><b>Answer:</b> It gives your customers a voice as well as an affective way for you to
            interact with them. It provides your customers with a fast and simple way to offer
            feedback or ask questions and it provides you with a very efficient system for
            responding, moderating comments, and managing the comment system.</dd>

          <dt><b>Question:</b> Is Oxygen XML Editor/Author required to use Oxygen Feedback?</dt>
          <dd><b>Answer:</b> No. Although, <b>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</b> is required to integrate
              <ph keyref="product"/>into WebHelp documentation, it can be embedded on any HTML-based
            webpage.</dd>

          <dt><b>Question:</b> Do I need my own server to manage and integrate Oxygen Feedback?</dt>
          <dd><b>Answer:</b> No. While this might be a beneficial feature in upcoming releases,
            there will always be cloud-based options for administering <ph keyref="product"/>
            without the need for your own server.</dd>

          <dt><b>Question:</b> Is there a demo or trial version so that I can see Oxygen Feedback in
            action?</dt>
          <dd><b>Answer:</b> Yes. If you already own a license for <b>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</b>,
            you can use <ph keyref="product"/> for free on one domain. If you do not have a license
            for <b>Oxygen XML Editor/Author</b>, you can request a 30-day trial at: <xref
              href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/register.html?p=editor" format="html"
              scope="external"/>.</dd>

          <dt><b>Question:</b> Can I decide which comments posted by my customers are
            displayed?</dt>
          <dd><b>Answer:</b> Yes. There is an option that specifies whether or not comments are
            moderated and if that option is enabled, all new or edited comments require approval
            from an administrator or moderator.</dd>
