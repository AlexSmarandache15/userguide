    <title>How to Change the Chapter and Section Numbering</title>
    <body>
        <p>The default transfomation numbers only the chapters. The sections and other nested subsections are not
            numbered. The following CSS example shows how to initialize CSS counters for the sections and how to use
            them in the TOC.</p>
        <p>There will be two sets of counters, one used in the TOC and the other in the content.</p>
