  <title>Using Breakpoints for Debugging Queries that Import Modules with MarkLogic</title>
  <body>
    <p>When debugging queries that imports modules stored in the database, it is recommended to
      place <term>breakpoints</term> in the modules. When starting a new debugging session, make
      sure that the modules that you will debug are already opened in the editor. This is necessary
      so that the breakpoints in all the modules will be considered. Also, make sure that there are
      no other opened modules that are not involved in the current debugging session.</p>
    <p>To place <term>breakpoints</term> in the modules, use the following procedure:<ol>
        <li>In the <uicontrol>Data Source Explorer</uicontrol> view, open all the modules from the
              <uicontrol><image href="../img/DBModules16.png"/>Modules</uicontrol> container of the
            <xref
            href="../tasks/configure-marklogic-connection.dita#configure-marklogic-connection/xdbc-step"
            >XDBC application server</xref> that performs the debugging.</li>
        <li><xref href="../tasks/inserting-breakpoints.dita#inserting-breakpoints">Set
            breakpoints</xref> in the module as needed.</li>
        <li><xref href="../tasks/steps-in-typical-debug-process.dita#steps-in-typical-debug-process"
            format="dita">Continue debugging</xref> the query.</li>
      </ol></p>
    <p>If you get a warning that the breakpoints failed to initialize, try the following solutions:<ul>
        <li>Check the <xref href="debug-breakpoints-view.dita#debug-breakpoints-view"
              ><uicontrol>Breakpoints</uicontrol> view</xref> and make sure there are no older
          breakpoints (set on resources that are not part of the current debugging context).</li>
        <li>Make sure you open the modules from the context of the application server that does the
          debugging and place breakpoints there.</li>
      </ul></p>
