    <p>The <uicontrol>General Settings</uicontrol> page includes an option to transfer the ownership
      of a site configuration to another user. You must be the <i>Owner</i> of the site
      configuration to access this option and the user you are transferring ownership to must have
      an <xref href="ofb-team-management.dita"><i>Admin</i> role</xref>.</p>
    <p>To transfer ownership of the site configuration, click the <uicontrol>Transfer</uicontrol>
      button, enter the new owner's email address, enter YOUR password, and click
        <uicontrol>Transfer</uicontrol>. A confirmation email will be sent to the specified user.
      They will need to access the email and accept the transfer within 24 hours (the pending owner
      can also go to the <uicontrol>General Settings</uicontrol> page and accept the transfer from
      there). You can click the <uicontrol>Cancel</uicontrol> button to reverse the action anytime
      before the user accepts the transfer.</p>
