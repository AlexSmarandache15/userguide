  <title>XML Well-Formedness Details for HTML Documents</title>
  <body>
    <p>When opening an HTML document in <uicontrol>Author</uicontrol> mode, if it is not XML
      well-formed, you will see a warning message at the top of the editor explaining that once you
      make a modification, the document will be automatically converted to proper XML structure
      (XHTML structure). Examples of things that are automatically converted include:<ul
        id="ul_yv4_d5b_nkb">
        <li>Missing end tags are added to applicable elements.</li>
        <li>Empty tags are closed.</li>
        <li>Missing quote characters are added to applicable attributes.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <note type="tip">It is also possible to manually convert an HTML document to be XML well-formed.
      This is achieved by right-clicking anywhere in the main editor for an open HTML document and
      selecting <uicontrol>HTML to XML Well-formed</uicontrol>. This results in unclosed tags being
      properly closed, unquoted attribute values being quoted, and more. This is helpful if, for
      example, you use XSLT stylesheets while applying transformations on HTML documents (since the
      transformation will require the HTML document to be XML well-formed).</note>
