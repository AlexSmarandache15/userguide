    <conbody>
    <p>A publishing template is stored either in a ZIP archive or in a folder. If it is a ZIP
      archive, you can extract it in a folder and link it in the <uicontrol>Project</uicontrol>
      view. Using the <uicontrol>Project</uicontrol> view, you can manage its resources.</p>
    <p>The publishing template's resources and the relations between them are listed in the
      publishing template descriptor. You can open it in the editor, the content completion and
      validation support will help you to edit it.</p>
