    <title>Failed to Run Pipeline: The entity cannot not be resolved through catalogs</title>
    <body>
        <p>You can get error messages like:</p>
        <codeblock>Failed to run pipeline: The entity SOME_ENTITY cannot not be resolved through catalogs. 
For security reasons files that are not listed in the DITA-OT catalogs and are not 
located in the DITA-OT directory are not read</codeblock>
        <p>when the security checks implemented in the default transformation have blocked the reading of files that are not part of the DITA-OT (Oxygen Publishing Engine) installation directory, and are not part of the transformed DITA map. </p>
        <p>You can disable these checks if the origin of the transformed content is known and trusted, by setting the transformation parameter <codeph>args.disable.security.checks</codeph> to <codeph>yes</codeph>.</p>
