    <title>Choosing the Fonts</title>
    <body>
        <p>An important step in making sure your document is published properly in different scripts is choosing a font that covers the entire set of characters from that script (language).</p>
        <p>However, you can specify a series of font families using the CSS <codeph>font-family</codeph> property that are used as fall-backs. Once a word cannot be rendered using the first specified font, the next font family is tried. In the following example, we use some common fonts available on Windows to make a CSS stylesheet capable of displaying properly a large number of languages, from all European to Asian:</p>
        <codeblock>* {
	font-family: Calibri, SimSun, "Malgun Gothic";	
}</codeblock>
        <p>Assigning a font for all the elements, and not relying on <xref href="ch_basic_fonts.dita">basic fonts</xref>, makes the document <xref href="ch_accessibility.dita">accessible</xref>.<note>If your CSS does not assign a font to a part of your document, then the following sequence of fonts are used: serif, Times, Times New Roman, Symbol, MingLiU, MS Mincho, Arial Unicode MS. This combination covers a wide character range, but might be different from what you need.</note></p>
