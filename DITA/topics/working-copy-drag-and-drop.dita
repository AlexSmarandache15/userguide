  <title>Drag and Drop Operations</title>
  <body>
    <p id="p_ilj_dgk_54b">The structure of the files tree can be changed with drag and drop operations inside the
        <uicontrol>Working Copy</uicontrol> view. These operations behave in the same way with the
        <uicontrol>Copy to</uicontrol>/<uicontrol>Move to</uicontrol> operations.</p>
    <p id="p_jlj_dgk_54b">Also, files and folders can be added to the file tree of the view as <i>unversioned</i>
      resources by drag and drop operations from other applications (for example, from Windows
      Explorer or macOS Finder). In this case, the items from the file system are only copied,
      without removing them from their original location.</p>
    <note type="attention" id="note_klj_dgk_54b">When you drag items from the working copy to a different application, the
      performed operation is controlled by that application. This means that the moved items are
      left as <i>missing</i> in the working copy (items are moved in the file system only, but
      no SVN versioning meta-data is changed).</note>
