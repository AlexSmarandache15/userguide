    <title>Using the Open AI Models</title>
    <body>
    <p>Open AI GPT3 is the largest commercial AI model available to integrators. It contains about
      175 billions weights, and it was trained on a huge corpus of text. Similar to other
      encoder/decoder language models, the training was done by 'hiding' some words from the input
      and asking the model to guess the missing word. </p>
    <image href="../img/open_ai_gpt3.png" id="image_ebr_tkq_5sb"/>
    <p>The resulting language model was able to find semantic connections between words, in some way
      'understanding' the meaning of a window of text, being capable of doing much more than it was
      trained to do initially, like responding to questions for instance. </p>
    <p>Advantages of Open AI GPT-3 Language Model:</p>
    <ol id="ol_qdk_gkq_5sb">
      <li>Semantic awareness</li>
      <li>Extensible</li>
      <li>‘Creative’</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Disadvantages:<ol id="ol_cms_hkq_5sb">
        <li>Slow due to network latency, content is sent to <tm tmtype="reg">Open AI</tm>
            servers.<note id="note_syv_xkq_5sb" type="important"> Check the license terms of the
            Open AI platform. Make sure your company agrees with sending parts of the edited
            document to the Open AI.</note></li>
        <li>Not always factually correct, probabilistic responses.<note id="note_zqd_kkq_5sb"
            type="important">Always check the generated content. It behaves more like a brain than a
            database.</note></li>
      </ol></p>
    <p>To use the GTP-3 language models  choose <uicontrol>Open AI</uicontrol> in the
        <uicontrol>Engine</uicontrol> panel. The interface will be displaying the following
        areas:<ol id="ol_rxq_2vp_5sb">
        <li>The list of proposals.</li>
        <li>A panel with actions that can transform the selected text from the editor.</li>
        <li>A control panel with three sections:<ol id="ol_nq2_hvp_5sb">
            <li><uicontrol>Model</uicontrol> - from this you can select the Open AI model you intend
              to use for providing completions. It can be one of the base models, or one you fine
              tuned (or trained) from your data. The default selection is
                <codeph>text-davinci-001</codeph>.<note id="note_j4n_kvp_5sb">The base models are
                named according to the following convention, they contain one of the following
                keyword: <codeph>davinci</codeph> signals the most capable model, then follows
                  <codeph>curie</codeph>, <codeph>babbage</codeph>, and <codeph>ada</codeph>.
              </note></li>
            <li><uicontrol>Fine-tune Jobs</uicontrol> - here you can start fine tune jobs. Once a
              fine tune job has finished, the resulting model is listed in the
                <uicontrol>Model</uicontrol> combo box. </li>
            <li><uicontrol>API Key</uicontrol> - you can configure here the Open AI API Key.</li>
