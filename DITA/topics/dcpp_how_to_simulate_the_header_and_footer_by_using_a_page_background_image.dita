    <title>How to Decorate the Header by Using a Background Image on the Entire Page</title>
    <body>
    <p>If you want to precisely position artwork and the page margin boxes are not sufficient, you
      may use this simpler approach: use a background image for the entire page. </p>
    <p>The technique consists in creating an image (SVG is the best since is a vector image) as wide
      as the page that would contain the logo and other decorations placed at the needed position.
      This offers the best results and the position of the artwork does not depend on the page
      margins contents.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-css">@page :left, chapter:left, chapter:first:left { 
 background-image: url('img/page_background_image_with_logos_and_artwork_for_left_page.svg');
 background-repeat: no-repeat;
 background-position: 50% 50%;
}</codeblock>
