          a <xref href="https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/5989" format="html" scope="external"
            >registered bug</xref> that makes the narrator read content from the side views when
          editing in the main editing area. Because of this, the following workflow is suggested:<p>
            <ol id="ul_qd1_r14_j3b">
              <li>Start <ph keyref="product"/>.</li>
              <li>Go to the <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol> menu and select <uicontrol>Maximize
                  Editing Area</uicontrol> (<uicontrol><shortcut>hold Alt, then W, then
                  M</shortcut></uicontrol>). This action will hide all side views and allow you to
                properly edit in the main editing area.</li>
              <li>Whenever you want to open a side view, go to <menucascade>
                  <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol>
                  <uicontrol>Show View</uicontrol>
                </menucascade> (<uicontrol><shortcut>hold Alt, then W, then
                S</shortcut></uicontrol>) and choose the view you want to open. For example, to show
                the <uicontrol>Elements</uicontrol> view, you can use the shortcut
                    <uicontrol><shortcut>hold Alt, then W, then S, then
                E</shortcut></uicontrol>.</li>
              <li>When you are done using the side view, go to the <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol>
                menu and select <uicontrol>Hide current view</uicontrol> (<uicontrol><shortcut>hold
                    Alt, then W, then H</shortcut></uicontrol>) to hide the side view and return the
                focus to the main editing area.</li>

      <title>Hints for the Visually Impaired</title>
      <p>Here are a few hints for using <ph keyref="product"/> if you are visually impaired:<ul
          id="ul_owd_cv5_xcb">
          <li>The top main menu contains actions to open, save, and close documents, switch between
            open documents, or switch between the various editing modes for XML documents that are
            already open. All actions in the main menu bar should have mnemonics making it possible
            to memorize various shortcuts. For example, using the <uicontrol>alt-w-s-e</uicontrol>
            shortcut should open the <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol> menu, open the <uicontrol>Show
              view</uicontrol> submenu from it and show the <uicontrol>Elements</uicontrol> view,<ul
              id="ul_hyq_hv5_xcb">
              <li>The <uicontrol>File</uicontrol> menu contains actions to open, save, or close the
                currently edited XML document.</li>
              <li>The <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> menu contains actions to undo/redo or
                cut/copy/paste content. They also have the usual shortcuts that can be used instead
                of directly invoking the actions from the menu.</li>
              <li>The <uicontrol>Find</uicontrol> menu contains an action to show the
                  <uicontrol>Find/Replace</uicontrol> dialog box. Sometimes the <b>JAWS</b> narrator
                overloads the <b>CTRL+F</b> shortcut and presents its own find/replace window but
                the <ph keyref="product"/>
                <uicontrol>Find/Replace</uicontrol> dialog box provides the ability to perform
                complex find/replace operations in the open file.</li>
              <li>In the <b>Options</b> menu, you have access to the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box
                that contains global application settings and access to the <b>Menu Shortcut
                  Keys</b> table where you can configure shortcuts for the most commonly used
                actions.</li>
              <li>The <b>Window</b> menu includes actions to switch between open XML documents.
                Also, you can use the <b>Show view</b> submenu to open a particular side view and
                move the focus to that view.</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>An open XML document can be edited with accessibility support either in the
              <b>Text</b> editing mode (where the XML tags are accessible in the edited content) or
            in the visual <b>Author</b> editing mode (where the XML tags are hidden and only the
            text content is shown). You can switch between these editing modes by using the <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Document</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Edit Mode</uicontrol>
            </menucascade> menu.<ul id="ul_jgk_nk1_ycb">
              <li>
                <p><b>Text</b> mode provides access to the entire source document with all of its
                    <b>XML</b> content, just like you have in any text editing application. </p>
                <p>Pressing the <b>&lt;</b> key will present a list of <xref
                    keyref="glossentry_content-completion-assistant">available XML elements</xref>,
                  if you do not want to choose from the list whenever you want to insert an XML
                  element you have two choices:<ul id="ul_bdq_sj4_llb">
                    <li>After the list of available XML elements is shown you can press the
                        <b>ESC</b> key to close it and continue manually inserting the XML tag.</li>
                    <li>You can disable the content completion list from the application <menucascade>
                        <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol>
                        <uicontrol>Editor / Content Completion</uicontrol>
                      </menucascade> page by unselecting the checkbox <uicontrol>Enable Content
                        Completion</uicontrol>. After content completion is disabled you can force
                      show it by using the <uicontrol>Ctrl-Space</uicontrol> keyboard shortcut.</li>
                  </ul></p>
                <p>In addition, using the <menucascade>
                    <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol>
                    <uicontrol>Show view</uicontrol>
                  </menucascade> submenu, you can change focus to the <b>Attributes</b>,
                    <b>Elements</b>, or <b>Outline</b> view. The <b>Attributes</b> view presents the
                  existing and possible attributes that can be inserted in an XML tag. The
                    <b>Elements</b> view shows you the list of XML elements that can be inserted at
                  the cursor position (also, pressing F2 on a selected element presents its
                  annotation). The <b>Outline</b> view shows the current path in the XML
                  structure.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Author</b> mode is useful for reviewing written XML content because it has
                  support for change tracking and for adding comments. Editing in the <b>Author</b>
                  visual editing mode, you have access only to the text content in the XML document. </p>
                <p>Pressing <b>Shift+F2</b> will read the current element context where the cursor
                  is located. Pressing <b>Ctrl+Shift+F3</b> will read the current element context
                  and the entire path in the XML structure where the cursor is located. You can also
                  use <b>Outline</b> view to better understand the XML structure. </p>
                <p>In the <b>Author</b> editing mode, you can also use the <b>Attributes</b> and
                    <b>Elements</b> views similar to using them in the <b>Text</b> editing mode.
                  Pressing <b>ENTER</b> in the <b>Author</b> visual editing mode can also be used to
                  present a list of allowed elements at the current position.</p>
