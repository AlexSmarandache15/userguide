  <title>Cannot Access a Repository through HTTPS</title>
  <body>
    <p>If you have issues when trying to access a repository through HTTPS protocol, one of the
      possible causes can be the encryption protocol currently used by the application. This is
      happening when the repository is set to use only one of the SSLv3 or TLSv1 encryption
      protocols.</p>
    <p>To solve this issue, set the <xref
        href="preferences-svn.dita#preferences-svn/svn_https_encryption_protocol" format="dita"
          ><uicontrol>HTTPS encryption protocols</uicontrol> option</xref> to <uicontrol>SSLv3
        only</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>TLSv1 only</uicontrol> (depending on the repository
      configuration).</p>
