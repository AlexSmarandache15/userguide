    <title>How to Remove 'on page NNN' Link Label</title>
    <body>
        <p>For paper printed materials, it is desirable that the links display a label (similar to
      "on page 54") after their text content. This gives the user the possibility to identify the
      target page. However, if the produced PDF is not printed on paper and is intended only for
      electronic use, this label may create clutter and makes the document harder to read. To
      eliminate this label, add the following in your <xref href="dcpp_the_customization_css.dita"
        >customization css</xref>:</p>
        <codeblock outputclass="language-css">*[class ~= "topic/xref"][href]:after,
*[class ~= "topic/link"][href]:after {
    content: none;
}</codeblock>
    </body>
