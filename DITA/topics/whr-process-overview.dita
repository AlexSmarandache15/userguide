  <title>Process Overview</title>
  <shortdesc>The WebHelp Responsive plugin is a DITA-OT plugin that allows you to transform a DITA
    based documentation to HTML format.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>WebHelp Responsive plugin inherits the multi-stage processing mode from the DITA-OT
      publishing engine. Each stage in the process examines some or all of the content; some stages
      result in temporary files that are used by later steps, while others stages result in updated
      copies of the DITA content. Most of the processing takes place in a temporary working
      directory; the source files themselves are never modified.</p>
    <p>The steps involved by the WebHelp Responsive transformation are:</p>
    <dl>
      <dlentry>
        <dt>p1</dt>
        <dd>p2</dd>
      </dlentry>
    </dl>
    <p>
      <note>The webhelp Responsive plugin uses the XSLT stylesheets from the DITA-OT XHTML
        plugin.</note>
