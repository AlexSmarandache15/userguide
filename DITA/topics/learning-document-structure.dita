        <p>When working with documents that do not specify a schema, or for which the schema is not
      known or does not exist, <ph keyref="product"/> is able to learn and translate the document
      structure to a DTD. You can choose to save the learned structure to a file to provide a DTD as
      an initialization source for <xref href="streamline-with-content-completion.dita">content
        completion</xref> and <xref href="validating-XML-documents.dita">document validation</xref>.
      This feature is also useful for producing DTD's for documents containing personal or custom
      element types.</p>
        <p>When you open a document that is not associated with a schema, <ph
                keyref="product"/> automatically learns
            the document structure and uses it for <xref
                href="streamline-with-content-completion.dita">content completion</xref>. To disable
            this feature you have to uncheck the checkbox <xref
                href="preferences-content-completion.dita"><uicontrol>Learn on open
                    document</uicontrol> in the user preferences</xref>.</p>
