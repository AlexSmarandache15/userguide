    <title>Security Policy Configuration</title>
    <body>
        <p>When running the product in an system where you do not control the input (XML files,
			CSS), you must take some steps in order to ensure that the transformation process does
			not access files outside the allowed locations, and does not connect to other hosts.</p>
		<ol id="ol_xkf_xpr_hpb">
			<li>Create a Java policy file. A sample Java policy file can be found here:
					<filepath>config/chemistry.policy</filepath>. You can use this as a starting
				point to grant or revoke permissions. Follow the instructions from this file.</li>
			<li>Specify the Java policy file location (in URL format) as command line
				parameter:<codeblock id="codeblock_xld_1qr_hpb" outputclass="language-bourne">chemistry.bat -security-policy file:/some/path/to/chemistry.policy</codeblock></li>
			<li>By default the font cache file is stored in the home directory, while the temporary
				files are stored in the system temp folder. It is recommended to specify a workspace
				directory where these files are to be stored. The sample policy file automatically
				sets read and write permissions on this
				folder.<codeblock id="codeblock_anc_q5r_hpb" outputclass="language-bourne">chemistry.bat -security-policy file:/some/path/to/chemistry.policy -workspace /path/to/dir</codeblock></li>
