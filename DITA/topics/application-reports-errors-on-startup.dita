      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>Sometimes after installing a new version of <ph keyref="product"/>, various errors are
        reported when the application starts.</p>

        <title>Cause</title>
        <p>This problem may occur if you install the application in a folder where an older version
          of the application was previously installed. Especially on Mac OS X, there is a
          possibility for older resources and libraries from the previous application to remain in
          the installation folder and break the functionality of the newer version of the
          application.</p>

        <title>Solution</title>
        <steps-informal>
          <p>Close the application and completely <xref href="uninstall-application.dita">uninstall
              it</xref>, then install it again. The user-specific settings are saved in a separate
            folder in the user home directory so they will not be lost.<ul id="ul_yf4_rrd_rlb">
              <li>On Mac OS X, you can move the entire application installation folder to the
                  <uicontrol>Trash</uicontrol>, then re-install.</li>
              <li>On Linux and Windows, you can <xref href="uninstall-application.dita">uninstall
                  using the facilities provided by the installer</xref>, then re-install.</li>
