    <title>How to Fix Disappearing Thin Lines or Cell Borders </title>
    <body>
		<p>There are cases in which thin lines are disappearing from the PDF viewer at certain zoom
			levels. This is caused by the limited resolution of the display, while a printer has a
			superior resolution and there should be no problem printing thin lines on paper. </p>
		<p>If the primary PDF target is the display, then you have to use thicker lines in your CSS
			customization, for example avoid using 1px,  and use 1pt or larger instead.</p>
		<p>If you are using Adobe Acrobat Reader, then you can enhance the display of thin lines.
			This behavior can be changed by going to <menucascade>
				<uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol>
				<uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol>
				<uicontrol> Page Display</uicontrol>
				<uicontrol>Enhance Thin Lines</uicontrol>
			</menucascade>. Unchecking this option makes thin lines displayed as row of gray pixels
			(through antialiasing) and they are not disappearing. Experiment by checking and
			unchecking the option.</p>
