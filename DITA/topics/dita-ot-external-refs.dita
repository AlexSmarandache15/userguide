      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>Referencing a DITA topic, map, or binary resource (for example, image) that is located
        outside of the folder where the main DITA map is located leads to problems when publishing
        the content using the DITA Open Toolkit.</p>

      <title>Solution</title>
      <p>The DITA-OT does not handle it well when references are outside the directory where the
        published DITA map is found. By default, it does not even copy the referenced topics to the
        output directory. </p>
      <p>To solve this, you have the following options:<ol id="ol_mkn_r34_l3">
          <li>Create another DITA map that is located in a folder path above all referenced folders
            and reference from it the original DITA map. Then transform this DITA map instead.</li>
          <li>Edit the transformation scenario and in the <b>Parameters</b> tab edit the
              <uicontrol>fix.external.refs.com.oxygenxml</uicontrol> parameter. This parameter is
            used to specify whether or not the application tries to fix such references in a
            temporary files folder before the DITA Open Toolkit is invoked on the fixed references.
            The fix has no impact on your edited DITA content. The allowed values are "false" and
            "true". The default value is false.<note type="important">The
                <uicontrol>fix.external.refs.com.oxygenxml</uicontrol> parameter is only supported
              when the DITA OT transformation process is started from <ph keyref="product"
