    <p><ph keyref="webappProduct"/> includes a built-in mechanism for restricting connections to
      untrusted hosts and code locations. There is a <uicontrol>Security</uicontrol> page in the
        <xref href="webapp-admin-page.dita"/> that provides options for handling security-related
      features, including an option for specifying trusted code locations and a firewall option
      where you can choose to restrict access to hosts that are not specified as being trusted.</p>

      <title>Trusted Code</title>
      <p>By default, Web Author does not load code (such as CSS or Schematron) referenced directly
        in documents unless it comes from the framework (document type association). However, you
        can specify code locations to be considered trusted by adding them in the <xref
          href="webapp-admin-page.dita#webapp-admin-page/trusted-code"><uicontrol>Trusted
            Code</uicontrol> option</xref> in the <uicontrol>Security</uicontrol> section of the
          <xref href="webapp-admin-page.dita"/>. The code locations need to be declared with URL
        patterns, one per line. For
        example:<codeblock outputclass="language-bourne">https://www.example.com/doc/help.php?product-webauthor&amp;pageId=my_topic
*example.css</codeblock></p>

      <title>Trusted Hosts</title>
      <p>It is possible to restrict the hosts that the Web Author server is allowed to connect to.
        The <uicontrol>Security</uicontrol> page in the <xref href="webapp-admin-page.dita"/>
        includes a <uicontrol>Firewall</uicontrol> option where you can choose to allow all
        connections or only allow connections to hosts that you specify as trusted. You can specify
        the hosts to be considered trusted by adding them (one per line) in the <xref
          href="webapp-admin-page.dita#webapp-admin-page/only-allow-connections"><uicontrol>Only
            allow connections to these trusted hosts</uicontrol> option</xref> in the
          <uicontrol>Security</uicontrol> section of the <xref href="webapp-admin-page.dita"/>. For
        example:<codeblock outputclass="language-bourne">devel-new.example.com:8089
localhost:8081</codeblock></p>
      <note>Plugins can specify whether a connection is allowed or denied, regardless of whether or
        not they are listed in the <uicontrol>Security</uicontrol> page.</note>
