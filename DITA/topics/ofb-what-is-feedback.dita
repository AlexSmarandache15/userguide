    <p><i><ph keyref="product"/></i> is a comment management platform that can be embedded in
      WebHelp Responsive output or any HTML-based website. It provides easy interaction with
      customers, whose feedback can be used to gain a better understanding of customer needs,
      continually improve products, documentation, or websites, and to make corrections in a timely
      manner. It also provides a very efficient medium for your community to ask questions and
      receive answers from you or other community members. It has a modern, stylish appearance that
      looks great on any website, it is very easy to integrate and configure, and it includes a
      user-friendly interface and numerous useful features for both Commenters and
      Administrators.</p>
    <p>It was originally intended to be an enhanced, modernized replacement for the feedback
      component in the <b>Oxygen XML WebHelp Responsive</b> online help system. WebHelp
      administrators desired greater flexibility for configuring options and moderating comments, an
      improved user-friendly interface, and a more modern design. As its development evolved, it was
      decided to also make <ph keyref="product"/> a standalone product so that not only can it be
      embedded in WebHelp Responsive pages, but also in any HTML-based webpage.</p>
