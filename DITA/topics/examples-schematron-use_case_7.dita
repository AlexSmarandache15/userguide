  <title>Schematron Use Case 7: Check the Location of a Resource</title>
  <body>
    <p><b>Description:</b> The following sample rule checks if the path to a resource (in this case,
      an image) is specified correctly. Specifically, this sample rule reports that the image must
      be located in the current project (the images location must be relative to the parent folder
      and no more than one <codeph>"../"</codeph> in the path.</p>
    <p><b>Sample Code:</b><codeblock outputclass="language-xml">&lt;sch:rule context="image"&gt;
    &lt;sch:report test="count(tokenize(@href, '\.\./')) &gt; 2"&gt;
        The image must be located in the current project. It is currently located
        in: &lt;sch:value-of select="@href"/&gt;
    &lt;/sch:report&gt;
&lt;/sch:rule&gt;</codeblock></p>
    <p><b>Result:</b> The engine displays an error message if an image is detected in a location
      other than the current project, relative to the parent folder.</p>
