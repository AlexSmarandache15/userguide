        <p>The publishing process is driven by a customization CSS. </p>
        <p>To change the styling of the output:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a custom CSS file that will contain all your customizations. It is
        recommended to create this file in your project directory. <note type="tip">You can organize
          the CSS rules in separate files, but they all need to be imported from a single master CSS
          file. For simplicity, this manual provides instructions based upon a single CSS
          file.</note><note><xref href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-less"
            format="html" scope="external">LESS</xref> files are supported (LESS is a CSS
          pre-processor with a CSS-like syntax, but has a lot of features designed to speed up
          development).</note></li>
            <li>Add the custom CSS rules. See the topics in this section for assistance with
        specific types of customizations.</li>
            <li>In the <uicontrol>DITA Map PDF - WYSIWYG</uicontrol> transformation scenario, set
        the full path to the custom CSS file as the value of the <codeph>args.css</codeph>
        parameter.</li>
