    <title>How to Switch Between Shallow and Deep Numbering</title>
    <body>
        <p>By default, only the first level topics (the chapters) are numbered. To have all the map
      hierarchy numbered you need to set the transformation parameter
        <codeph>args.css.param.numbering</codeph> to <codeph>deep</codeph>.</p>
    <p>In the following topics you will get some technical details, in case you need to fine tune
      the way numbering works.</p>
