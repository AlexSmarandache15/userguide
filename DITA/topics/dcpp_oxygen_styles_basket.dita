    <p><xref href="https://styles.oxygenxml.com/" format="html" scope="external">Oxygen Styles Basket</xref> is a web-based application created to help users generating their CSS customizations. </p>
    <p>It is based on galleries that you can use to pick and mix styles aspects to create custom look and feel. Each aspect should be selected to be integrated on the CSS stylesheet (such as fonts, tables, lists, spacing, code, etc...) and then downloaded as a CSS file (or as a publishing template file).</p>
    <p>It is also possible to re-upload a previously generated CSS for further customization. </p>
