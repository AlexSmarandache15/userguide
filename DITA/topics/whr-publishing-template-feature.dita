    <draft-comment author="radu_pisoi">Should explain the publishing template concept from the user
      perspective without many developer notes.</draft-comment>
    <p>A <i>oXygen Publishing Template</i> was designed as a <b>self-contained package</b> stored
      either as a <b>ZIP archive</b> or as a folder on disk. This makes more <b>easier to share</b>
      a publishing template with others.</p>
    <p>The <ph keyref="product"/> and publishing template concept are <b>tightly integrated with
        oXygen XML Editor/Author</b> making the process to create, configure and publish more
      easier.</p>
