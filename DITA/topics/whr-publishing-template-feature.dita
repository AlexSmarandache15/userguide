    <draft-comment author="radu_pisoi">Should explain the publishing template concept from the user
      perspective without many developer notes.</draft-comment>
    <p>A <i>oXygen Publishing Template</i> was designed as a self-contained package stored either as
      a ZIP archive or as a folder on disk. This makes more easier to share a publishing template
      with others.</p>
    <p>The <ph keyref="product"/> and publishing template concept are tightly integrated with oXygen
      XML Editor/Author making the process to create, configure and publish more easier.</p>
