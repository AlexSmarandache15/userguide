    <p><term>SVG</term> (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a platform for two-dimensional graphics. It
      has two parts: an XML-based file format and a programming API for graphical applications. Some
      of the key features include support for shapes, text, and embedded raster graphics with many
      painting styles, scripting through languages such as <term>ECMAScript</term>, and support for
      animation.</p>
    <p>SVG is a vendor-neutral, open standard that has important industry support. Companies such as
      Adobe, Apple, and IBM have contributed to its W3C specifications. Many documentation
      frameworks (including DocBook) have support for SVG by defining the graphics directly in the
      document.</p>
    <p><ph keyref="product"/> adds SVG support by using the <xref

      package (an open source project developed by the Apache Software Foundation) and the <xref
        href="using-XML-Catalogs.dita">default XML catalog</xref> resolves the SVG DTD.<note>Batik
        partially supports SVG 1.1. For a detailed list of supported elements, attributes, and
        properties, see the <xref href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/status.html"
