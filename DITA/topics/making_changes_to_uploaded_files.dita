        <p>As the <b>Reviewer</b>, you can click on any of the files attached to the task to open it
      in a version of the Oxygen XML Web Author editor. This is where you can proofread, make
      changes, and add comments in the files.</p>
    <section id="task_files_panel">
      <title>Task Management Panel</title>
      <p>The left panel lists all the files and messages that are attached to the task. You can
        switch files simply by clicking on the file in this left panel. You can add a new message
        from this panel and the <uicontrol>Finish</uicontrol> button can be used to indicate that
        you are finished reviewing all files and it offers some <xref
          href="#making_changes_to_uploaded_files/finalizing_your_changes" format="dita">predefined
          messages</xref>. Keep in mind that all messages in this panel are attached to the task and
        not to individual files (to annotate individual files, use the <xref
          href="#making_changes_to_uploaded_files/add-comment" format="dita"><uicontrol>Add
            Comment</uicontrol> button</xref> in the editor). All files attached to the task should
        be reviewed before using the <uicontrol>Finish</uicontrol> button. </p>

    <section id="visual_editor">
      <title>Visual Editor</title>
      <p>This visual editor allows you to review and edit content similar to common word processors.
        In most cases, the <term>tracked changes</term> feature will always be on so you and the
          <b>Content Author</b> can see exactly what was changed and the <b>Content Author</b> will
        be able to easily accept or reject the changes.</p>

    <section id="toolbar_actions">
      <title>Toolbar Actions</title>
      <p>The editor also includes a toolbar with actions that are specific to the type of document.
        Most <b>Reviewers</b> will only be interested in the buttons located on the
          <uicontrol>General</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Review</uicontrol> toolbars. These actions
        include:</p>
      <p>

          <dlentry>
            <dt><uicontrol><image href="../img/Undo16.png"/> Undo</uicontrol></dt>

                <uicontrol>Tags Display Mode</uicontrol> to control the amount of XML markup that is
              displayed, or you can change the interface language and enable automatic spell
              checking.</dd>

      <title>Review View</title>
      <p>The editor also includes a menu panel on the right side with some helper views. If the menu
        panel is not displayed, click the arrow button (<image href="../img/WA_open_arrow.png"/>) on
        the far right side of the editor. Most <b>Reviewers</b> will only be interested in the
          <uicontrol>Review</uicontrol> view. It displays the <term>tracked changes</term> and
        comments that have been added to the document and each change or comment includes actions
        such as <uicontrol>Reply</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Mark as Done</uicontrol>,
          <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>Remove</uicontrol>.</p>

    <section id="finalizing_your_changes">
      <title>Finalizing Your Changes</title>
      <p>All of your changes are saved automatically. However, the files will remained locked and
        others cannot access them until you close the editor by navigating back to the <xref
          href="content_fusion_user_interface.dita#content_fusion_user_interface">Task Details
          page</xref> or close the browser. The best and easiest way to do this is by clicking the
          <uicontrol>Finish</uicontrol> button in the left panel. This button allows you to select
        some predefined messages to offer feedback or let the <b>Content Author</b> the status of
        the review process. Keep in mind that all files attached to the task should be reviewed
        before using the <uicontrol>Finish</uicontrol> button because messages in this panel apply
        to the whole task and not to individual files.</p>
      <p>When you click the <uicontrol>Finish</uicontrol> button, the predefined messages are as follows:<ul>
          <li><b>Looks good</b> - The most common use for this selection is when you want to let the
              <b>Content Author</b> know that all the files in the task have been reviewed and they
            look good without the need of making any changes.</li>
          <li><b>See my proposed changes</b> - The most common use for this selection is when you
            want to let the <b>Content Author</b> know that you have made some proposed changes in
            one or more of the files attached to the task and they can use their judgement to
            integrate the changes.</li>
          <li><b>See my proposed changes and resend for review</b> - The most common use for this
            selection is when you want to let the <b>Content Author</b> know that you have made some
            proposed changes in one or more of the files attached to the task and you want them to
            integrated the changes and then let you review them again.</li>
          <li><b>Someone else should look at this</b> - The most common use for this selection is
            when you want to let the <b>Content Author</b> know that you think someone else should
            look at the files. You can enter your suggestion for who that person should be in the
              <b>Details</b> field or you could <xref
              href="sharing_uploaded_tasks.dita#sharing_uploaded_tasks">share the task</xref> with
            that person.</li>
          <li><b>Other</b> - The most common use for this selection is when you want to enter your
            own message in the <b>Details</b> field.</li>
        </ul></p>
