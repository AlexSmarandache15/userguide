    <p>As the <b>Reviewer</b>, you can click on any of the files attached to the task to open it in
      a visual editor. This is where you can proofread, make changes, and add comments in the
      files.</p>
    <p>

    <section id="task_files_panel">
      <title>Left-Side Task Management Panel</title>
      <p>The resizeable left panel lists all the files and messages that are attached to the task.
        You can switch files simply by clicking on the file in this left panel. You can use the
          <uicontrol>Add Message</uicontrol> button to add a new message for the <b>Content
          Author</b> or other <b>Reviewers</b> and the <uicontrol>Finalize Review</uicontrol> button
        can be used to indicate that you are <xref href="finishing_tasks.dita#finishing_tasks"
          >finished reviewing all files</xref>. Keep in mind that all messages in this panel are
        attached to the task and not to individual files (to annotate individual files, use the
          <xref href="#making_changes_to_uploaded_files/add-comment" format="dita"><uicontrol>Add
            Comment</uicontrol> button</xref> in the editor). All files attached to the task should
        be reviewed before using the <uicontrol>Finalize Review</uicontrol> button.</p>
      <p>For DITA projects, if the <b>Content Author</b> specified a context DITA map, this panel
        shows the hierarchy of all the attached files as they appear in the specified DITA map. The
        topic title hierarchy from the DITA map is also displayed underneath each topic and if part
        of it is not shown, you can hover over it to see the entire title hierarchy in a
        tooltip.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="visual_editor">
      <title>Visual Editor</title>
      <p>This visual editor allows you to review and edit content similar to common word processors.
        In most cases, the <term>tracked changes</term> feature will always be on so you and the
          <b>Content Author</b> can see exactly what was changed and the <b>Content Author</b> will
        be able to easily accept or reject the changes.</p>

    <section id="toolbar_actions">
      <title>Toolbar Actions</title>
      <p>The editor also includes a toolbar with some common actions as well as others that are
        specific to the type of document (framework). Most <b>Reviewers</b> will only be interested
        in the buttons located in the first two sections of toolbar actions. These actions
        include:</p>

              select a <uicontrol>Tags Display Mode</uicontrol> to control the amount of XML markup
              that is displayed, and you can change the interface language or enable automatic spell

      <title>Right Side Panel (Review View, Attributes View, Validation View)</title>
      <p>The editor also includes a menu panel on the right side with some helper views. If the menu
        panel is not displayed, click the arrow button (<image href="../img/WA_open_arrow.png"/>) on
        the far right side of the editor. Most <b>Reviewers</b> will only be interested in the
          <uicontrol>Review</uicontrol> view. It displays the <term>tracked changes</term> and
        comments that have been added in the document and each change or comment includes actions
        such as <uicontrol>Reply</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Mark as Done</uicontrol>,
          <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>Remove</uicontrol>.</p>
      <p>Advanced users might find the <uicontrol>Attributes</uicontrol> or
          <uicontrol>Validation</uicontrol> views helpful. The <uicontrol>Attributes</uicontrol>
        view allows you to see and edit the attributes of a selected element and their values. The
          <uicontrol>Validation</uicontrol> view provides information about validation problems and
        offers proposals for resolving them (if a <term>Quick Fix</term> is available).</p>

      <title>Saving Files</title>
      <p>All of your changes are saved automatically on the <ph keyref="product"/> server. If you
        want to save a file manually, use the <uicontrol
          conkeyref="reusable-oxygen-shortcuts-list/ctrl_s"/> key shortcut. You can also download
        the file to your local file system by selecting <uicontrol><image

    <section id="unlocking_files">
      <title>Unlocking Files</title>
      <p>While your editing a file, the file remains locked and others cannot edit it. The file will
        be unlocked when you close the editor by navigating back to the <xref
          href="content_fusion_user_interface.dita#content_fusion_user_interface">Task Details
          page</xref> or close the browser. Using the <uicontrol>Finalize Review</uicontrol> button
        will also automatically navigate back to the Task Details page and unlock the file.</p>
      <p>If you remain inactive for more than a few minutes, the editor switches to read-only mode
        and the file is unlocked, which means other users have access to edit it. If other users do
        not start editing the file, or once they are finished and it becomes unlocked, a
          <uicontrol>Resume Editing</uicontrol> button will be displayed that can be used to switch
        back to editing mode. Note that the lock status is automatically refreshed every minute, so
        if another user unlocks a file, you may not see the status change for a minute unless you
        refresh the page manually.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="finalizing_your_changes">
      <title>Finalizing Your Changes</title>
      <p>Once you are done reviewing all files attached to the task, click the <uicontrol>Finalize
          Review</uicontrol> button in the left panel. Using this button is a quick and easy way to
        let the <b>Content Author</b> know that you are finished with review process. Keep in mind
        that all files attached to the task should be reviewed before using the <uicontrol>Finalize
          Review</uicontrol> button because it applies to the whole task and not to individual
        files.</p>
