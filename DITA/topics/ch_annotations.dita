    <p>In the above image the commented sections are shown in yellow, the deleted content is in
      red.</p>
    <p>To create annotations in your PDF document you should create a specific structure in your
      document. In the following you will see how this structure may look like for XML documents and
      HTML documents.</p>
    <p>In case you want to style the change elements as plain elements in the content, using CSS
      rules, you can disable the annotation processing using the command line parameter:
        <codeph>-noPDFAnnotationsForChangeTrackingAndComments</codeph>.</p>
