    <p><b>Oxygen XML WebHelp Responsive</b> output is compliant with the <xref

      <?oxy_comment_start author="Radu Pisoi" timestamp="20180522T053838+0000" comment="It is not accessible for all disabilities. Maybe we can tell that helps people with disabilities (at general) to read documentation."?>accessible

    <p>Generally speaking, the WebHelp Responsive output has two major parts: topic content and
      WebHelp Responsive-related components (publication TOC, breadcrumb, menu).</p>
    <p>While the WebHelp Responsive components are designed to comply with the accessibility rules,
      it is important to adhere to some rules when you write DITA topics so that the content is also
      accessible. </p>
