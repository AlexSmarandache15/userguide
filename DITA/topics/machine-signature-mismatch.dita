      <title>Problem</title>
      <p>During the license activation process, the license key becomes bound to a particular
        license server deployment. This means that a code that uniquely identifies your license
        server deployment (called <term>Machine Signature</term>) is sent to the <ph
          keyref="product"/> servers, which in turn will sign the license key. The <term>Machine
          Signature</term> is computed from the list of network interfaces of the machine where you
        deployed the license.</p>

        <title>Causes</title>
        <p>When starting the license server, if you receive an error stating that your server's
          Machine Signature does not match the one found in your license key, there are several
          possible causes:<ol>
            <li>You have moved your license key to a new machine that hosts your license
              server.</li>
            <li>You have changed, added, or activated a new network interface in the machine that
              hosts your license server.<note>A specific example of when this could happen is if you
                activate/deactivate the Bluetooth or the WiFi module.</note></li>
          </ol></p>
