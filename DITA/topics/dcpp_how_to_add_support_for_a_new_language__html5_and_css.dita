    <title>How to Add Support for a New Language (HTML5 and CSS)</title>
    <body>
        <p>In case the list of supported languages does include the language you need, you can
			create a custom dictionary for this transformation.</p>
		<p>The DITA-OT documentation offers an good insight on how to to it: <xref
				href="https://www.dita-ot.org/3.2/topics/plugin-addgeneratedtext.html" format="html"
				scope="external"/></p>
		<p>In addition to that, you need to alter your CSS. Some of the labels are coming from CSS files
			located in: </p>
		<codeblock outputclass="language-ini">[PLUGIN_DIR]/css/print/i18n/</codeblock>
		<p>You should use one of the files as a template and copy its rules to your customization CSS
			and translate the labels. Make sure you change also the <codeph>:lang</codeph> selector to
			match your language code.</p>
