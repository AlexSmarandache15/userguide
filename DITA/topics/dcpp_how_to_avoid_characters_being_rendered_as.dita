  <title>How to Avoid Characters Being Rendered as #</title>
  <body>
    <p id="p_l4t_cgk_54b">When the processor renders text with a font that does not include certain
      characters, those characters are replaced with the <codeph>#</codeph> symbol. This can easily
      be seen from Oxygen's Results view, for
      example:<codeblock id="codeblock_hwb_1rt_kqb" outputclass="language-java">[CH] Glyph "?" (0x7ae0) not available in font "Roboto-Regular".</codeblock></p>
    <p id="p_m4t_cgk_54b">To prevent this, make sure you use the proper font.</p>
    <p id="p_n4t_cgk_54b">As an example, suppose the right arrow character is used in a definition list like this:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-xml" id="codeblock_o4t_cgk_54b">&lt;dlentry>
  &lt;dt>&amp;#8594;&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>&lt;ph>This is the right arrow.&lt;/ph>&lt;/dd>
&lt;/dlentry></codeblock>
    <p id="p_p4t_cgk_54b">If the font does not include this character, the output will look something like this:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-ini" id="codeblock_q4t_cgk_54b">  #
    This is the right arrow.</codeblock>
    <p id="p_r4t_cgk_54b">To fix this, use a fallback font. For example, if you use <i>Times New Roman</i> for the
      entire publication, you could add <i>Symbol</i> as the fallback font. In your <xref
        href="dcpp_the_customization_css.dita">customization CSS</xref>, add:</p>
    <codeblock outputclass="language-css" id="codeblock_s4t_cgk_54b">*[class ~= "topic/dlentry"] {
  font-family: "Times New Roman", Symbol;
}</codeblock>
    <note type="tip" id="note_t4t_cgk_54b">On Windows, one simple way to determine the font needed to display the text is
      to copy the text fragment that has rendering problems from the DITA source document and paste
      it into Microsoft WordPad or Word. It will automatically select a font capable of rendering
      the text. Simply click on the text to see the name of the font from the "Font" ribbon toolbar.
      Then you can use it as a fallback font in the CSS. Make sure there are no licensing
      restrictions on that particular font.</note>
    <note id="note_itz_2rt_kqb" type="warning">Even if the message is a warning, sometimes it can
      lead to a transformation fail. This usually occurs for really special characters (different
      from letters or common characters).</note>
