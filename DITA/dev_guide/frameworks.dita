            validation, content completion and visual editing support for a certain XML vocabulary. </p>
        <p>Usually a framework customization provides a schema used to validate and edit certain
            type of XML documents, a CSS used to edit the XML documents in the Author visual editing
            mode and various custom actions or behaviors used to enhance the editing experience.</p>
        <p>Oxygen comes out of the box with a lot of framework configuration folders
                (<b>OXYGEN_INSTALL_DIR/frameworks</b>) to support editing XML
            documents of various types like DocBook, DITA, XHTML or TEI. All these existing
            framework configurations can be further configured in the Oxygen
                <b>Preferences->Document Type Associations</b> page. These framework
            configurations can be used as examples for <xref
