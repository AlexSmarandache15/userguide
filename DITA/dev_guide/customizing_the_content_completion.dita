    <title>Customizing the content completion proposals</title>
    <body>
        <p>When editing an XML document either in the <b>Text</b> or in the <b>Author</b> editing
            modes you can invoke the content completion window (Ctrl-Space in the Text editing mode
            or <b>ENTER</b> in the Author viual editing mode) to see the allowed XML elements  or
            attributes which can be inserted at the caret position. In addition the <b>Elements</b>
            view also presents the elements which can be inserted in the document at a certain
            position. Also the <b>Attributes</b> view presents a list of attributes and for each
            attribute a set of values are proposed.</p>
        <p>The content completion proposals can be customized in various ways:<ul
                id="ul_rqk_mzz_pgb">
                <li>Each framework can contain a special content completion configuration file:
                        <xref
                        href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/20.1/ug-editor/topics/configuring-content-completion-proposals.html"
                        format="html" scope="external"/>. Such a file can:<ul id="ul_wxs_vzz_pgb">
                        <li>Filter out element proposals for a parent element.</li>
                        <li>Configure a set of required attributes which will get inserted along
                            with a certain element.</li>
                        <li>Add new attribute value proposals and for each proposal add an
                            annotation which will appear in the Attributes view for each value.</li>
                        <li>Call an external XSLT script to compute value proposals for a certain
                            attribute.</li>
                        <li>Customize how the element names are presented in the Outline, Elements
                            view and Content Completion proposals window.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>By altering the schema which is associated to the XML document. For example in
                    the case of the <b>DITA</b> vocabulary you may create a DTD specialization
                    plugin and integrate it in Oxygen: <xref

                <li>By using tin a framework configuration the <xref

                    filter using Java code the set of proposed elements and attribute values.</li>
