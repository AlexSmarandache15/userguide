    <title>Workspace Access Plugin</title>
    <body>
        <p>This type of <xref href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/glossary/plugin.html"
                format="html" scope="external">plugin</xref> extension allows you to contribute
            actions to the main menu and toolbars, create custom views, interact with the
            application workspace, make modifications to opened documents, and add listeners for
            various events. It is the most useful and used extension when writing a plugin.</p>
        <p>A workspace access plugin can also provide frameworks, allowing you to have a single
            add-on that provides both workspace-level extensions (independent of any given
            framework) and doctype-specific frameworks). If the frameworks involve Java extensions
            (for example, custom dialogs or link text resolvers), they use the Java code as packaged
            for the workspace access plugin.</p>
        <p>You include frameworks with a workspace access plugin by declaring an "additional
            frameworks" extension in the plugin's plugin.xml file: <xref
                href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/20.1/ug-editor/topics/additional-framework-extension.html"
