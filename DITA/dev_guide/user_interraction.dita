    <body>
        <p>Your plugin most of the times needs to interract with the end user. You can find below
            some possibilities to do that:
            <ul id="ul_dwq_hzj_rgb">
                <li>Your plugin can create Swing components (dialogs, frames) based on the Java
                    Swing architecture and can show them when

                     to create a dialog which already has
                    <b>Ok</b>
                     and
                    <b>Cancel</b>
                     buttons added to it. This specific dialog base also automatically resizes its
                    internal components depending on the current used fonts or DPI settings and also
                    properly positions its
                    <b>OK/Cancel</b>
                     buttons depending on the operating system in which Oxygen is started (on Mac
                    OSX the
                    <b>OK</b>
                     button is on the right part of the dialog while on Windows and Linux it's
                    placed on the left part of the dialog). There is an entire

                     which contains base implementations of Swing components and such
                    implementations are recommanded to be used in order for the plugin-contributed
                    components to look like the ones contributed by Oxygen.</li>
