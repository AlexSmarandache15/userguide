        <p>A <b>plugin </b>can be used to customize the behavior of the entire application no matter
            what XML document is currently being edited. As Oxygen is a Java application most of the
            allowed plugin types are Java-based but there is also a Javascript-based plugin type. </p>
        <p>There are lots of <xref

                format="html" scope="external">plugin types</xref> but the <xref
                href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/topics/workspace-access-plugin.html"
                format="html" scope="external">Workspace Access</xref> plugin type is the most
            versatile one. This type of <xref
                href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/glossary/plugin.html"
                format="html" scope="external">plugin</xref> allows you to contribute actions to the
            main menu and toolbars, create custom views, interact with the application workspace,
            make modifications to opened documents, and add listeners for various events.</p>
        <p>The Maven-based <xref href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/oxygen_sdk.html" format="html"
                scope="external">Oxygen SDK</xref> is freely available, comes with sample plugins
            and it allows you to compile Java extensions for your plugins and frameworks. But as a
            quick start for a Workspace Access plugin you can use this project: <xref
                href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/sample-plugin-workspace-access" format="html"
                scope="external"/>. </p>
        <p>The Workspace Access plugin API can also be used with a <xref
                href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/topics/workspace-access-plugin-js.html"
                format="html" scope="external">Javascript-based plugin</xref>. Small
            Javascript-based plugin samples can be found here: <xref
                href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/wsaccess-javascript-sample-plugins" format="html"
                scope="external"/>.</p>
        <p>You can create automated tests for your plugins: <xref
                href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/topics/automated-tests-x-sdk2.html"
                format="html" scope="external"/> and you can also debug them using the Eclipse IDE:
                <xref href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/topics/debug-plugin.html"
                format="html" scope="external"/>.</p>
        <p>A plugin can be installed either manually or it can be packed as an add-on and installed
            using Oxygen's <b>Help->Install new add-ons...</b> functionality: <xref
