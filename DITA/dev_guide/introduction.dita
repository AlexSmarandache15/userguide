        <p>Oxygen XML Editor allows you to develop add-ons in order to customize the editing
            experience. Such a customization can be either a plugin or a framework.

                    <b>plugin </b>
                     can be used to customize the behavior of the entire application no matter what
                    XML document is currently being edited.

                    specific XML vocabulary.

            as long as they are only used from inside Oxygen:
