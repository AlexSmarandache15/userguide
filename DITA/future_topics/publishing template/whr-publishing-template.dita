              important use case covered by the <term>oXygen Publishing Template</term> is that you
              can use it to <b>share a WebHelp Responsive customization</b> with your team. Or you
              can develop it using <ph keyref="product"/> standalone application and then use it in
              a continuous integration system to publish your documentation whenever it was
              changed.</p></li>
