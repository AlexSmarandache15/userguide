      <p>Each <b>WebHelp Publishing Template</b> includes a descriptor file which defines the
      meta-data associated with that template. It is an XML file that defines all the resources
      included by a template like HTML page templates, CSS, JS, fonts, transformation
      parameters.</p>
    <p><?oxy_comment_start author="radu_pisoi" timestamp="20180129T154356+0200" comment="Maybe we can add a screenshoot with the structure of a descriptor."?>The
      template descriptor file should have the .opt extension (debugger.opt) and it should be
      located in the root folder associated with the template.<?oxy_comment_end?></p>
      <note>It is recommended to edit the template descriptor in the oXygen XML editor because to
      get content completion and validation.</note>
