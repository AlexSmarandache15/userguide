      <p>Each WebHelp Publishing template includes a descriptor file which defines the meta-data
        associated with that template. The template descriptor is an XML file that defines all the
        resources included by a template like HTML page templates, CSS, JS, fonts, transformation
        parameters.</p>
      <p>It is an XML file that should be located in the root folder associated with the
        template.</p>
      <note>It is recommended to edit it in the oXygen XML editor because you will get content
        completion and validation.</note>
