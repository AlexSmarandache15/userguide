    <title>Troubleshooting licensing problems</title>
    <body>
        <p>It may happen that users are not able to open XML files because Web Author cannot obtain
            a valid license to use. To troubleshoot this issue there are several things to check</p>

            <title>Web Author connection details for License Server are configured correctly</title>
            <p>You can go to the Admin Page and check the <xref

            <title>Web Author cannot connect to License Server over HTTP</title>
            <p>This problem is linked to the deployment setup that you chose. There are several
                possible causes:<ul id="ul_pb1_gc2_2db">
                    <li>On Windows there is an anti-virus software or firewall that blocks the
                        connection between Web Author and License Server. You may need to add
                        exceptions for this connection.</li>
                    <li>Due to the server configuration, Web Author uses IPv6 to connect to License
                        Server. You can force IPv4 by <xref
                            href="../../topics/webauthor-set-system-property.dita#webauthor-set-system-property"
                            >setting the following System
                        Property</xref>:<codeblock>java.net.preferIPv4Stack=true</codeblock></li>
                    <li>The connection passes through an HTTP proxy server that blocks this
                        connection - you can add an exception in Web Author for the License Server
                        using the <xref href="../../topics/webapp-proxy-settings.dita">Proxy
                            Configuration Page</xref>.</li>
                    <li>The License Server uses a self-signed HTTPS certificate (or another
                        certificate that is not trusted by default in Java). In this case you can
                        use the <uicontrol>Connection</uicontrol> section of the Administration Page
                        to configure Web Author to accept any HTTP certificate.</li>
                </ul></p>

                    <li>Check the application server access logs to check whether requests made by
                        Web Author are received by the License Server. </li>

            <title>License Server setup is incorrect</title>
            <p>This might include<ul id="ul_zyz_sf2_2db">
                    <li>The License Server is not started.</li>
                    <li>The License Server is not configured with a license.</li>
                    <li>The License Server is configured with a license for a different

                    <li>The version of the License Server is not compatible with Web Author</li>

            <p>Most of these problems can be checked by going to the License Server's administration
